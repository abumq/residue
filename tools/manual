.SH DESCRIPTION
Residue is a real-time remote logging server that is secure, efficient with memory and CPU. It allows application to send log messages in real-time. See https://amrayn.github.io/residue for more details.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-v
Enable verbose logs level 9
.TP
.BI \--v=1-9
Enable verbose logs of specified level
.TP
.BI \--force-without-root
Normally residue requires you to run it as \fIroot\fR. You can use this option to force starting the server without root.
The reason of this requirement is because residue needs to change file permissions for specified log files to specified users (as per your config file) which needs super-user access.
.TP
.BI \--attach-crash-handler
Attaches crash handler to the server. If it crashes, it will log it (with stack trace) to the internal logging file (as specified in your config) before shutting down.
