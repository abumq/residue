# Client API
Residue comes with [official C++ client library](https://github.com/abumq/residue-cpp) for users to use in their C++ applications. You can easily integrate residue in to your existing C++ application with literally 3 changes.

For other client libraries please refer to corresponding repository.

### 1. Download Library and Header
You need 2 things to connect to residue

1. `residue.h` header file - this contains API for connecting to the residue server
2. `libresidue` (a dynamic library) - you will need to link your application to this library in order to successfully compile.

We highly recommend usage of `libresidue-static` static library as dynamic linking will need applications to further link to other dynamic libraries.

### 2. Define `ELPP_THREAD_SAFE`
Make sure you define `ELPP_THREAD_SAFE` preprocessor at compile level (whole application takes this affect)

### 3. Initialize
In your `main()`, send connection to residue. (NOTE: Residue server should be running in order to connect otherwise you will get error)

```c++
#include <residue/residue.h>

int main() {
   
    // Connects to localhost on Residue::DEFAULT_PORT (8777)
    /
    / You can catch ResidueException for connection failure
    Residue::connect();
    
    ///
    /// Start logging using Easylogging++ macros i.e, LOG(INFO) etc
    ///
    /// If you wish to log using specific logger you will have to use CLOG(INFO, "<logger-id>")
    /// See https://github.com/abumq/easyloggingpp#logging for details
    ///
    
    // It's always best to safely disconnect before your application ends, this ensures 
    // all the logs have been flushed to the server
    Residue::disconnect();
    
    return 0;
}
```
