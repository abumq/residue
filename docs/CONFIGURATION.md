# Configuration

This document gives you details on configuring residue

Residue is fully configurable to support various features and for security. Configuration is always in [JSON](http://json.org/) format.

You can use [Server Config Tool](https://abumq.github.io/residue/create-server-config) to generate configurations for your server

### `admin_port`
[Integer] Port that admin server listens to. All the admin requests are sent to this port. These requests must be encrypted using [`server_key`](#server_key).

Default: `8776`

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/admin_port.md)

### `connect_port`
[Integer] Port that connection server listens to. All the connection requests are sent to this port and handled accordingly. This is the port that all the clients libraries initially connect to.

Default: `8777`

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/connect_port.md)

### `logging_port`
[Integer] Port that logging server listens to. This is where all the log requests are sent.

Default: `8778`

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/logging_port.md)

### `default_key_size`
[Integer] Default symmetric key size (`128`, `192` or `256`) for clients that do not specify key size. See [`key_size`](#managed_clientskey_size)

Default: `256`

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/default_key_size.md)

### `server_key`
[String] A 256-bit server key that is used for admin services. See [`admin_port`](#admin_port)

Default: Randomly generated and residue outputs it in start-up

### `server_rsa_private_key`
[Optional, String] RSA private key (PEM format file path). You can use `$RESIDUE_HOME` environment variable in this file path. If provided, it is used to read initial requests for extra security.

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/server_rsa_private_key.md)

### `server_rsa_public_key`
[String] Corresponding public key for [`server_rsa_private_key`](#server_rsa_private_key). You can use `$RESIDUE_HOME` environment variable in this file path.

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/server_rsa_public_key.md)

### `server_rsa_secret`
[String] If private key is encrypted, this is the secret (passphrase) to decrypt it. **THIS SHOULD BE HEX ENCODED**.

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/server_rsa_secret.md)

### `enable_cli`
[Boolean] Whether CLI is enabled on server or not. See [CLI_COMMANDS.md](/docs/CLI_COMMANDS.md) for possible input commands.

Default: `true`

### `enable_dynamic_buffer`
[Boolean] Dynamic buffer is a feature that allows failed logs (logs that were failed to be written to file) to be clogged up in an internal buffer. Once logs can be written to the file all the logs from this dynamic buffer will be flushed to the file so no logs are lost.

You can turn this feature on or off with this flag.

**NOTE** This is an experimental feature introduced in v2.1.1 and should not be used in production at this point.

Default: `false`

### `allow_insecure_connection`
[Boolean] Specifies whether plain connections to the server are allowed or not. Either this should be true or server key pair must be provided (or both)

Default: `true`

### `allow_unmanaged_loggers`
[Boolean] Specifies whether loggers other than the ones in [`managed_loggers`](#managed_loggers) list are allowed or ignored / rejected.

Default: `true`

### `allow_unmanaged_clients`
[Boolean] Specifies whether clients other than the ones in [`managed_clients`](#managed_clients) list are allowed or ignored / rejected.

Default: `true`

### `immediate_flush`
[Boolean] Specifies whether to flush logger immediately after writing to it or not. Performance of the server is not affected with turning it on as we use separate thread for logging.

Default: `true`

### `requires_timestamp`
[Boolean] Specifies whether timestamp is absolutely required or not. Timestamp is `_t` value for each incoming requests.

This does not affect admin requests, timestamps for admin requests is always required.

See [`timestamp_validity`](#timestamp_validity)

Default: `true`

### `compression`
[Boolean] Specifies whether compression is enabled or not.

Default: `true`

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/compression.md)

### `file_mode`
[Integer] Default file mode for the log files

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/file_mode.md)

### `allow_bulk_log_request`
[Boolean] Specifies whether clients can send bulk log requests or not.

See [`max_items_in_bulk`](#max_items_in_bulk) and [`compression`](#compression)

Default: `true`

### `max_items_in_bulk`
[Integer] Maximum number of bulk items allowed.

If client sends more requests than this all the extra requests are ignored by server (with verbose warning). User is not informed about this as we handle log requests asynchronously.

Default: `5`

You may be interested in [`compression`](#compression)

### `timestamp_validity`
[Integer] Integer value in seconds that specifies validity of timestamp `_t` in request

Minimum: `30`

Default: `120`

### `client_age`
[Integer] Value (in seconds) that defines the age of a client. After this age, client is considered _dead_. Clients library can `TOUCH` request just before (subject to `TOUCH_THRESHOLD` value in the library) dying to bring it back to life provided it's not already dead. After client is dead, it needs to reconnect and obtain a new key.

Default: `259200` (3 days)

Minimum: `120`

Forever: `0` (not recommended)

### `non_acknowledged_client_age`
[Integer] Value (in seconds) that defines the age of a client that is not yet acknowledged by client library.

Note: You cannot `TOUCH` a non-acknowledged client.

Minimum: `120`

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

Cannot set it to *forever*

### `client_integrity_task_interval`
[Integer] Value that should be >= `client_age` or `non_acknowledged_client_age` (whichever is lower).

This is a task that ensures integrity of the clients to remove dead clients that are unusable

Default: `300` or `min(client_age, non_acknowledged_client_age)` [whichever is higher]

Minimum: `300`

### `dispatch_delay`
[Integer] Value that defines the delay (in milliseconds) between two log message dispatch.

**Note** Increasing this value is going to slow down your server (for obvious reasons, i.e, it's a delay).

Default: `1` (recommended)

Maximum: `500`

Turn off delay: `0` (not recommended)

### `archived_log_directory`
[String] Default destination for archived logs files

Default: It must be provided by the user

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/archived_log_directory.md)

### `archived_log_filename`
[String] Default filename for archived log files.

Default: It must be provided by the user

See [`default_key_size`](#default_key_size)

#### `managed_clients`::`loggers`
[Optional, Array] Object of logger IDs that must be present in [`managed_loggers`](#managed_loggers) array.

This is to map the client with multiple loggers. Remember, client is not validated against the logger using this array, this is only for extra information.

#### `managed_clients`::`default_logger`

Default: Current process user

[Learn more...](/docs/configurations/managed_clients/user.md)

### `managed_clients_endpoint`
[String] This is URL where we can pull *more* managed clients from. The endpoint should return JSON with object [`managed_clients`](#managed_clients), e.g,

            "configuration_file" => "samples/configurations/blah.conf"
        ),
    ),
);

echo json_encode($list);
```

Call this file `localConfig.php` and run it as server `php -S localhost:8000`

Endpoint URL is `http://localhost:8000/localConfig.php`

See [archived_log_compressed_filename](#archived_log_compressed_filename)

#### `managed_loggers`::`archived_log_directory`
[String] Overrides default [`archived_log_directory`](#archived_log_directory) to logger specific directory.

See [archived_log_directory](#archived_log_directory)

### `managed_loggers_endpoint`
[String] This is URL same as [`managed_clients_endpoint`](#managed_clients_endpoint) with JSON object containing same properties as [`managed_loggers`](#managed_loggers)

### `extensions`
[Array] Contains various types of extensions. You can specify each type of extension's array shared library modules.

Extensions API documentation is available [here](https://abumq.github.io/residue/extensions/)

**NOTE You will need `libresidue-extension` in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**

### `loggers_blacklist`
[Array] String where each string is logger ID. Whenever request using these loggers are received, they are ignored without notifying the user.

## Comments
Because Residue configuration is in JSON format, comments are not supported as there should be no comment in JSON file. With that said there are ways to have comments around it.

1. You can have a seperate "object" for comment e.g,

```javascript
...
    "comment", "following backup directory will be in original logging directory",
    "archived_log_directory": "%original/backups/%logger/",
    "comment", "another comment",
    "archived_log_filename": "%hour-%min-%day-%month-%year.log",
    "comment", "another comment",
    "archived_log_compressed_filename": "%hour-%min-%day-%month-%year.tar.gz",
    "managed_clients": [
...
```

Please note, this is not preferred way as parsing may get slower with increasing comments.

2. You can have comment using `//` or `/* */` in the file and then before you pass it on to residue, run it through jsMin. e.g, for file `test.json`

```javascript
...
    // following backup directory will be in original logging directory
    "archived_log_directory": "%original/backups/%logger/",
    // another comment
    "archived_log_filename": "%hour-%min-%day-%month-%year.log",
    // another comment
    "archived_log_compressed_filename": "%hour-%min-%day-%month-%year.tar.gz",
    "managed_clients": [
...
```

```
cat test.json | jsmin > test-nocomments.json && residue test-nocomments.json
```

**This is preferred way** as it will only pass on what is really needed.

## Sample
Please refer to [sample configuration file](/samples/residue.conf.json) for understanding it better.
